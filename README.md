As a heavy user of Apple's environment in a world where people try to create only one experience for all available platforms, I try to be the person that equilibrates it by bringing our users the best possible experience according to their platform.

Regarding releases, I have experience in both Apple and Google Play stores, beyond other kinds of application deployments like websites and APIs.

Also, I have already worked with most of Firebase's solutions - like Analytics, Crashlytics, Remote Config (feature flagging), and more.

I do have experience working in international teams, where all the communication is entirely in English.

## My projects

Also, I have my own initiatives and side-projects: all of them are based on [Implementa](https://github.com/hulki-app).
