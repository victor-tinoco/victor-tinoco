## About

As a mobile engineer and architect, my expertise spans not only high-level technical execution but also visionary leadership in transformative and impactful digital experiences for millions.

At MGM Resorts, my role as a Flutter software engineer has been pivotal. We have implemented features in less than a month that increased the company's revenue by +5%. I've dominated all the guest-focused features domains and helped to re-implement most of these flows, improving a lot the user's experience. These achievements reflect my technical prowess, operational excellence commitment, and focus on user satisfaction.

My leadership was instrumental in the mobile development of BTG Trader, the stocks trading app of the largest investment bank LATAM. As one of the heads of this mobile project, I helped drive the app towards exponential growth, securing +20k users daily and over R$1 million in investments within just 8 months. We've overridden the old application, with less than 3 stars of rating at the stores, with a new white label implemented from scratch with 4+ stars. This accomplishment underscores my ability to lead with a forward-thinking vision, driving both technological innovation and business growth.

I have experience with several different technologies, like web and server-side development, Firebase expertise, and more. My focus has always been addressing real challenges, I'll always go beyond the tickets, as an "ex-" designer I love the product area and my commitment is to the user's experience always building a lovable product.

## My projects

I have a few initiatives and side projects, you can find them at [Implementa](https://github.com/hulki-app).
