I'm currently working on [Aya Healthcare](https://github.com/AyaHealthcare/), the largest healthcare staffing company in the United States.

Flutter into Aya Healthcare is an incoming technology that is growing and taking advantage of other stacks. I came as a specialist to help them to make the best use of it. We are re-skinning some applications and building a common design system package to be used across them.

That is my first full-time performance in an international team, where all the communication is entirely in English.

## My projects

Also, I have my own initiatives and side-projects: all of them are based on [Implementa](https://github.com/hulki-app).
